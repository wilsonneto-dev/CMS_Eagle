## Eagle CMS
#### The best way to simplify the admin's panel for your simple site.

> This project is prepared for docker containers, all the Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml file are configured.

> This project uses PHP 5.6 and MySQL > 5.6 ~ 7

#### The objectives:

- The main objective is to obtain a `simple`, `fast` and `flexible` alternative to get up a CMS Admin in minutes.
- `lightweight` (So lite if compared with others CMS, like Wordpress)
- So simple setup, just configure the `appsettings.json` and the `models.json` (on src folder)  

#### The features

- Protect the CMS with login (You can create new users, groups and manage the permissions of each one)
- Auto generate CRUD's
- Auto generate beautiful and responsive Admin Pannel using Bootstrap and Lite Admin Theme.

#### Alerts:
- The main difference from others CMS is: this project is destinated to the admin pannel (and only the admin pannel). I suggest to run your site that will consume the database generated by this admin panel in a separeted app and containner, using PHP 7~8, redbean ORM and Twig Front Engine.

- This project is destinated to small sites, and the admin just generate CRUD's pannels and user policy to manage that contents.
